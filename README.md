**Overview of the Project**
Project: Student Grade Tracker
__Objective__:
The objective of the provided Java code (StudentGrade.java) is to calculate and display the average grade, letter grade, and GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the grades entered by the user for a given number of subjects.
**Key Activities**:
The provided Java code (StudentGrade.java) performs several key activities related to grading and GPA calculation based on user input.Input Handling
Prompting for Number of Subjects:The program asks the user to enter the number of subjects for which grades will be entered.
Grade Input:It then iterates through each subject, prompting the user to input the grade for each subject.
Grades are stored in an array (grades).
Calculation of Average Grade: 
Total Calculation:It ,computes the total sum of all grades entered. 
Average Calculation:Calculates the average grade by dividing the total sum by the number of subjects.
Grade Conversion:getLetterGrade Method, getGPA Method
Output
Display:
Prints the calculated average grade, letter grade, and GPA to the console.
Formats the average grade and GPA to two decimal places for clarity.
**Technologies Used**:
Scanner Class, Arrays, Control Flow (if-else), String Formatting (System.out.printf)
The code snippet provided demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts and techniques for handling user input, performing calculations, and formatting output. It serves as a practical example for educational purposes and basic command-line applications.
